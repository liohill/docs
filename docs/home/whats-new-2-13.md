## Version 2.13.0

### Release content

This version contains features and fixes from previous versions starting with 2.9. Refer to the prior versions for specific features and fixes. For information about features, functionality, and fixed issues in previous versions see:

* [What's new 2.12](whats-new-2-12.md)
* [What's new 2.10](whats-new-2-10.md)
* [What's new 2.9](whats-new-2-9.md)

**Projects**
<!-- RUN-9312/9313 Projects V2 -->
* Improved the **Projects** UI for ease of use. **Projects** follows UI upgrades and changes that are designed to make setting up of components and assets easier for administrators and researchers. To configure a project, see [Projects](../admin/admin-ui-setup/project-setup.md).

**Dashboards**

<!-- RUN9530/9577 New Dashboard for Quota management -->
* Added a new dashboard for Quota management, which provides an efficient means to monitor and manage resource utilization within the AI cluster. The dashboard filters the display of resource quotas based on *Departments*, *Projects*, and *Node pools*. For more information, see [Quota management dashboard](../admin/admin-ui-setup/dashboard-analysis.md#quota-management-dashboard).

* Added to the Overview dashboard, the ability to filter the cluster by one or more node pools. For more information, see [Node pools](../Researcher/scheduling/using-node-pools.md) 

<!-- RUN-9359/9360 Incorporating Node Pools in Workspaces -->
**Nodes**

* A node is a worker machine that runs workloads, and a node pool is group of nodes within a cluster that all have the same configuration. Node pools use node labels as its identification. Run:ai has added a table for viewing nodes and for configuring node pools. To configure a node pool, see [Configuring node pools](../Researcher/scheduling/using-node-pools.md#creating-new-node-pools).

<!-- RUN-9960/9961 Per node-pool GPU placement strategy -->
* Run:ai scheduler supports 2 scheduling strategies: Bin Packing (default) and Spread. For more information, see [Scheduling strategies](../Researcher/scheduling/strategies.md). You can configure the scheduling strategy in the node pool level to improve the support of clusters with mixed types of resources and workloads. For configuration information, see [Creating new node pools](../Researcher/scheduling/using-node-pools.md#creating-new-node-pools).

<!-- RUN-10287/10317/10313-10851 Show Node pools priority list according to workspace policy -->
* Added Node pool selection as part of the workload and workspace submission form. This allows researchers to quickly determine the list of node pools available and their priority. Priority is set by dragging and dropping them in the desired order of priority. In addition, when the node pool priority list is locked by an administrator policy, the list isn't editable by the Researcher even if the workspace is created from a template or copied from another workspace.

<!-- RUN-10105/10106 Align Departments with Projects V2 -->
* Added support for node pools to *Departments*, including new columns in the *Departments* grid.

**Integrations**

<!-- RUN-9651/9652 Schedule and support of Elastic Jobs (Spark) -->
* Added support for SPARK and Elastic jobs. For more information, see [Running SPARK jobs with Run:AI](../admin/integration/spark.md#).

<!-- RUN-8748/8958 RUN-9627/10483 WANDB-SWEEP & Run.ai integration / WANDB SWEEP Integration - phase 2 -->
* Added sweep to Weights and Biases job submission. Sweep combines a strategy for exploring hyperparameter values with the code that evaluates them. The strategy can be as simple as trying every option or as complex as Bayesian Optimization and Hyperband (BOHB). To configure WANDB sweep, see [Sweep configuration](../admin/integration/weights-and-biases.md#sweep-configuration).

<!-- RUN-9024/9027 Ray Support - schedule and support of Ray Jobs -->
* Added support for Ray jobs. Ray is an open-source unified framework for scaling AI and Python applications. For more information, see [Integrate Run:ai with Ray](../admin/integration/ray.md#integrate-runai-with-ray).

**Workload assets**

<!-- RUN-9270/9274 - Interactive Time limit Fixes -->
* Improved timeout policy behavior. Any workload that reaches the time limit is now suspended or stopped. The administrator can change the time limit and the timeout for new and already running workloads. Already running workloads will update and stop based on the new settings.

<!-- RUN-8862/9292 - Department as a workspace asset creation scope - phase 1 -->

* Added a selection function <!-- The tree is not the essence here, it is what the tree enables - selection based on the organizational structure and everywhere in the hierarchy. Needs validation with Lior --> to the scope field when creating a new asset. You can select assets tht are available from anywhere in the organization from the tree.  Included assets are *Environment*, *Compute resource*, and some types of *Data source*.

<!-- RUN-9364/10850 Search box for cards in V2 assets -->
* Added a search box for cards in *Workspaces*, *Trainings*, and *Templates* to provide an easy way to search for assets and resources. The search box is available in any section where there is a card gallery and will filter based on titles or field values.

**Environments**
<!-- RUN-8862/9292 - Department as a workspace asset creation scope - phase 1 -->
* Added a tree selection function to the scope field when creating a new environment. For more information see, [Creating a new environment](../Researcher/user-interface/workspaces/create/create-env.md#creating-a-new-environment).

<!-- RUN-9843/9852 - Allow researcher to create docker registry secrets -->
* Added *Docker registry* to the *Credentials* menu. Users can create docker credentials for use in specific projects for image pulling. To configure credentials, see [Configuring credentials](../admin/admin-ui-setup/credentials-setup.md#configuring-credentials).

<!-- RUN-8453/8454/8927 Technical documentation of 'Projects new parameters and options' use existing namespace, status, and more added to projects v2-->

**Researcher API**

<!-- RUN-8631/8880 Researcher API for train jobs -->
* Extending researcher's API to allow stopping & starting workloads via API (see [Submitting Workloads via HTTP/REST](../developer/cluster-api/submit-rest.md)).

**Policies**
<!-- RUN-10588/10590 Allow workload policy to prevent the use of a new pvc -->
* Improved policy support by adding `DEFAULTS` in the `items` section in the policy. The `DEFAULTS` section sets the default behavior for items declared in this section. For more information and an example of a PVC default, see Policies, [Complex values](../admin/workloads/policies.md#complex-values).

<!-- RUN-9270/9274 - Interactive Time limit Fixes -->
* Improved timeout policy behavior. Any workload that reaches the time limit is now suspended or stopped. The administrator can change the time limit and the timeout for new and already running workloads. Already running workloads will update and stop based on the new settings.

<!-- RUN-9826/10186 Support PVC from block storage -->
* Added support for PVC block storage in the *New data source* form. In the *New data source* form for a new PVC data source, in the *Volume mode* field, select from *Filesystem* or *Block*. For more information, see [Create a PVC data source](../Researcher/user-interface/workspaces/create/create-ds.md#create-a-pvc-data-source).

<!-- RUN-8904/8960 - Cluster wide PVC in workspaces -->
* Added support for making a PVC data source available to all projects. In the *New data source* form, when creating a new PVC data source, select *All* from the *Project* pane.
