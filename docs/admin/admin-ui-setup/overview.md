# User Interface Overview

Run:ai provides a single user interface that, depending on your role, serves both as a control-plane management tool and a researcher workbench.

The control-plane part of the tool allows the administrator to:

* Analyze cluster status using [dashboards](dashboard-analysis.md).
* Manage Run:ai metadata such as [users](admin-ui-users.md), [departments](department-setup.md), and [projects](project-setup.md).
* View Job details to be able to help researchers solve Job-related issues.

The researcher workbench part of the tool allows Researchers to submit, delete and pause [Jobs](jobs.md), view Job logs etc.

## Setup

The cluster installation process requires [configuring a new cluster](../runai-setup/cluster-setup/cluster-install.md).
On SaaS-based installations, the cluster creation wizard requires a URL to the cluster as explained [here](../runai-setup/cluster-setup/cluster-prerequisites.md#).

## Architecture

* Run:ai saves metadata such as users, projects, departments, clusters, and tenant settings, in the control plane residing on the Run:ai cloud.
* Workload information resides on (sometimes multiple) GPU clusters.
* The Run:ai user interface needs to work with both sources of information.

As such, the chosen architecture of the user interface is:

* The user interface is served from the management backend.
* The user interface connects directly to multiple GPU clusters using *cross-origin access*. This works using [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS){targe=_blank}: Cross-origin resource sharing. This allows submitting workloads and getting extended logging information directly from the GPU clusters.
* Meta-data, such as Projects, Settings, and Job information is synced into the management backend via a cluster-sync service. Cluster-sync creates an outbound-only channel with no incoming HTTPS connections.  

!!! Important note
    One corollary of this architecture is that for SaaS-based tenants, the user interface will only be able to access the cluster when the browser is inside the corporate firewall. When working outside the firewall. Workload-related functionality such as Submitting a Job, viewing Job lots etc, is disabled.

## System Messages

System administrators can use *system messages* to make announcements to users once they have logged in. These messages typically are used to keep user informed about different aspects of the platform.

To configure an *Administrator message*:

1. Press `Settings | General`.
2. Expand the *Message from administrator* pane.
3. Press *Message*.
4. Enter your message in the text box. Use the formatting tools in the toolbar to add special formatting or links to the message.
5. Enable the `Display "Don't show this again" checkbox on message to users to allow the users to see the message only once.
6. Press *Publish* when complete.
   When publishing a message, it appears on the screen for any logged-in user and every time users are logged in
